# Evntra

Evntra is a centralized university competition management platform for students, organizers, and administrators. It brings together competition discovery, registration, approvals, conflict detection, notifications, analytics, and calendar scheduling in one place so that universities can manage events without spreadsheets or fragmented communication.

The application is built with PHP 8.1+, MySQL 8.0+, vanilla JavaScript, and custom CSS. It includes a role-based auth system, a public landing page, searchable competition listings, organizer workflows for creating and editing events, admin moderation, Chart.js analytics, FullCalendar.js scheduling, PHPMailer-powered messaging, and a responsive dark-accented interface designed for desktop and mobile.

## Features

- Public landing page with featured competitions
- Student registration, login, password reset, dashboards, bookmarks, and competition browsing
- Organizer competition creation, edit flow, registration management, analytics, and conflict warnings
- Admin competition approval, user management, and conflict reporting
- JSON APIs for browse search, bookmarks, registrations, notifications, calendars, and conflict checks
- CSRF protection, prepared statements, password hashing, and login rate limiting
- Banner uploads with MIME and size validation

## Setup

1. Clone or open the project folder.
2. Import the database schema from `sql/schema.sql` into MySQL 8.0+.
3. Create a MySQL database named `unicompete_hub` or update the credentials in `.env`.
4. Configure environment variables or a local `.env` file:

```env
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=unicompete_hub
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=
APP_URL=http://localhost/evntra
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com

SMTP_USER=your-smtp-user
SMTP_PASS=your-smtp-password
SMTP_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM=no-reply@evntra.test
MAIL_FROM_NAME=Evntra
```

5. Install the PHP dependency for email support:

```bash
composer install
```

6. Make sure `uploads/banners/` is writable by the web server.
7. Start PHP through your preferred local web server and browse to `/index.php`.
